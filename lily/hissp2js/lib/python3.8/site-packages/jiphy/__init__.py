"""jiphy/__init__.py.

Write your client side code in a Jiphy! Jiphy is a two-way Python->Javascript converter. It's not meant to create
runnable Python code from comlex JavaScript files, or runnable JavaScript from comples Python projects. Instead,
Jiphy enables Python programmers to more easily write JavaScript code by allowing them to use more familiar syntax,
and JavaScript developers to more easily write Python code.

Jiphy's Design Objectives:

- Reduce the context switching necessary for a Python developer to write JavaScript code and vice versa.
- Always output 1:1 line mappings (a line of Python produces a line of JavaScript) so source maps are not necessary.
- Be usable for a single developer on a project (Shouldn't require all developers to switch to using Jiphy).
- Should be easy to write text-editor plugins that expose Jiphy within IDEs for on-the-spot conversion.
